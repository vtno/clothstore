== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* run redis server and rails server and go to localhost:3000 to get to the app.

#run these two commands:

_$redis-server_
_$rails-s_


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
