== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* run redis server and rails server and go to localhost:3000 to get to the app.

#run these two commands:

<tt>$redis-server</tt>
<tt>$rails-s</tt>


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
